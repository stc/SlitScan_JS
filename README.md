A ProcessingJS implementation of the Slitscan effect: introducing how to 
use the users webcam in order to access and process its pixels.
	
The colours of the vertical center line of the live camera feed are
mapped to small ellipses which are then moving from left to right as
a slit scanner.  

The code uses the getUserMedia() call which is under heavy development,
currently working fine only with Google Chrome.
